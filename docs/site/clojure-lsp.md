# Clojure-lsp

Calva uses a mix of static and dynamic analysis to power the experience. A lot of the static abilities come from [clojure-lsp](https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp). This enables you to check something up in a project, with a lot of navigational and contextual support, without starting a REPL for it. (And once you do start a REPL you'll get even more capabilities, enabled by the dynamic analysis.)

!!! Note
    Calva defaults to using the `latest` clojure-lsp released. To use a different version of clojure-lsp, see the [configuration](#configuration) section. **Calva does not use the clojure-lsp installed on your system, unless you [set the path for clojure-lsp](#using-a-custom-clojure-lsp-native-binary) to the installed binary in your settings**. You can see what version is being used by running the `Clojure-lsp Server Info` command, which will also show the version of clj-kondo that's being used as well as other info. 

## The LSP server starts automatically

Unless you set `calva.enableClojureLspOnStart` to `false`, Calva will automatically start clojure-lsp. And you won't need to install antyting, because Calva handles that. It can take a while for clojure-lsp to start, though. Especially the first time for a new project, when clojure-lsp (via `clj-kondo`) indexes the project files.

Calva will show a status bar message during the download and while the server is starting, which will go away once the server is ready. However, _much of Calva's functionality is available regardless of the LSP server_, so please start using Calva while this server is starting.

Therea are commands for stopping and starting the clojure-lsp server. And you can also disable the autostarting using the `calva.enableClojureLspOnStart` setting (we recommend to keeping the default here and always enjoy clojure-lsp goodness).

## Ignoring LSP cache files

Clojure-lsp stores its project analysis information in your project. Git users can add these lines to their project root directory `.gitignore`:

```
.clj-kondo/cache/
.clj-kondo/.cache/
.lsp/sqlite.*.db
```

## Configuration

For information about how to configure clojure-lsp, see the [settings](https://clojure-lsp.github.io/clojure-lsp/settings/) page of the clojure-lsp docs.

### Changing the Version of Clojure-lsp Used by Calva

By default, Calva will use the latest released **clojure-lsp**. You can change the version of clojure-lsp used by Calva by setting the `calva.clojureLspVersion` property to a version of clojure-lsp found in its GitHub [releases](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/releases). This can be helpful if you're debugging an issue with clojure-lsp or you want to try out a feature of a new release that Calva does not yet use. However, you must remember to reset this setting in order for Calva to automatically use newer versions of clojure-lsp that are released with new versions of Calva.

Example:

```json
"calva.clojureLspVersion": "2021.04.07-16.34.10"
```

If you have specified a version and want to use the latest release, either remove the setting, or set it to `latest`.

### Using a Custom Clojure-lsp Native Binary

You can set a path to a clojure-lsp binary to be used by Calva by setting the `calva.clojureLspPath` setting. This should be an absolute path. When this is set, the binary at the path will be used and the `calva.clojureLspVersion` setting will be ignored.

Example:

```json
"calva.clojureLspPath": "/usr/local/bin/clojure-lsp"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Viewing the Logs Between the Client and Server

If something doesn't seem to be working correctly, and you suspect the issue is related to clojure-lsp, a good place to start investigating is the request and response logs between the LSP client and server. In your settings, set `clojure.trace.server` to `verbose`, then in the VS Code output tab, select the `Clojure Language Client` output channel.

!["Clojure trace server setting"](images/clojure-lsp/trace-server-setting.png "Clojure trace server setting")

It may be helpful to clear the output channel, then perform the action with which you're experiencing a problem, then read through the log for clues or paste the logs into a related issue in the Calva repo.

### Server Info Command

You can run the `Clojure-lsp Server Info` command to get information about the running clojure-lsp server, such as the version the server being used, the version of clj-kondo it's using, and more. This info is printed to the "Calva says" output channel.

### Opening the Server Log File

You can open the clojure-lsp log file by running the command `Calva Diagnostics: Open Clojure-lsp Log File`. The log file will only be opened with this command if the clojure-lsp server is running and has finished initializing. If you need to open the file when the server is failing to run or initialize, see the [clojure-lsp docs](https://clojure-lsp.io/troubleshooting/#server-log) for information on the file location.
